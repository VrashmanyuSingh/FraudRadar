# FraudRadar
Fraud Radar is a real-time fraud detection project built using machine learning. It simulates a real-world system that flags suspicious financial transactions based on behavior patterns, and model predictions.  This project is part of my learning-in-public journey, focused on building practical skills, solving meaningful problems.
